# Grouped Data frequency analysis

## Introduction

This project is a web application developed using Django for managing student information. It provides functionalities for registering students, calculating descriptive statistics on their ages, visualizing age distribution, and analyzing skewness. Additionally, the application calculates and visualizes Z-scores based on student ages.

## Features

- **Student Registration:** Allow users to register students with information such as age and full name. Each student entry includes registration and update timestamps.

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate and display descriptive statistics such as mean, mode, median, standard deviation, and skewness of student ages.

- **Age Distribution Visualization:** Visualize the age distribution of students using histograms and frequency tables.

- **Cumulative Frequency Analysis:** Display cumulative frequency graphs to understand the distribution of student ages.

- **Z-score Calculation:** Implement functionality to calculate Z-scores for each student based on their age, considering the mean and standard deviation of the entire dataset.

- **Z-score Visualization:** Visualize Z-score distributions using a normal curve, highlighting extreme values.

- **User Interface:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction with the application.

- **Admin Panel Integration:** Integrate functionalities into the Django admin panel for efficient management of student data.

- **Export/Import Data:** Provide options to export and import student data using CSV files for ease of data manipulation and sharing.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and unexpected errors gracefully.
